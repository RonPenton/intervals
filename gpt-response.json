Minimal sensation of leg effort/fatigue. Requires no concentration to maintain pace, and continuous conversation possible. Typically used for active recovery after strenuous training days (or races), between interval efforts, or for socializing.\n* Aerobic Endurance\n    * “All day” pace, or classic long slow distance (LSD) training. Sensation of leg effort/fatigue generally low, but may rise periodically to higher levels (e.g., when climbing). Concentration generally required to maintain effort only at highest end of range and/or during longer training sessions. Breathing is more regular than at level 1, but continuous conversation still possible. Frequent (daily) training sessions of moderate duration (e.g., 2 h) at level 2 possible (provided dietary carbohydrate intake is adequate), but complete recovery from very long workouts may take more than 24 hs.\n* Tempo\n    * Typical intensity of fartlek workout, ‘spirited’ group ride, or briskly moving paceline. More frequent/greater sensation of leg effort/fatigue than at level 2. Requires concentration to maintain alone, especially at upper end of range, to prevent effort from falling back to level 2. Breathing deeper and more rhythmic than level 2, such that any conversation must be somewhat halting, but not as difficult as at level 4. Recovery from level 3 training sessions more difficult than after level 2 workouts, but consecutive days of level 3 training still possible if duration is not excessive and dietary carbohydrate intake is adequate.\n* Lactate Threshold\n    * Just below to just above TT effort, taking into account duration, current fitness, environmental conditions, etc. Essentially continuous sensation of moderate or even greater leg effort/fatigue. Continuous conversation difficult at best, due to depth/frequency of breathing. Effort sufficiently high that sustained exercise at this level is mentally very taxing – therefore typically performed in training as multiple ‘repeats’, ‘modules’, or ‘blocks’ of 10-30 min duration. Consecutive days of training at level 4 possible, but such workouts generally only performed when sufficiently rested/recovered from prior training so as to be able to maintain intensity.\n* VO2 Max\n    * Typical intensity of longer (3-8 min) intervals intended to increase VO2max. Strong to severe sensations of leg effort/fatigue, such that completion of more than 30-40 min total training time is difficult at best. Conversation not possible due to often ‘ragged’ breathing. Should generally be attempted only when adequately recovered from prior training – consecutive days of level 5 work not desirable even if possible.\n* Anaerobic Capacity\n    * Short (30 s to 3 min), high intensity intervals designed to increase anaerobic capacity. Heart rate generally not useful as guide to intensity due to non-steady-state nature of effort. Severe sensation of leg effort/fatigue, and conversation impossible. Consecutive days of extended level 6 training usually not attempted.\n* Neuromuscular power\n    * Very short, very high intensity efforts (e.g., jumps, standing starts, short sprints) that generally place greater stress on musculoskeletal rather than metabolic systems. Power useful as guide, but only in reference to prior similar efforts, not TT pace.\n---\n\n**## User Information**\n\n* Plan start date: **2025-07-21**\n* Plan end date: **2025-07-27**\n* Functional Threshold Power (FTP): **212 watts**\n* Coggan Power Zones:\n    - Zone 1: Active Recovery (0-117 W)\n    - Zone 2: Endurance (117-159 W)\n    - Zone 3: Tempo (159-191 W)\n    - Zone 4: Threshold (191-223 W)\n    - Zone 5: VO2 Max (223-254 W)\n    - Zone 6: Anaerobic Capacity (254-318 W)\n    - Zone 7: Neuromuscular Power (318+ W)\n\n---\n\n**## Restrictions**\n\nHonor these constraints when planning the week:\n\n- 7/7 will be a light recovery day.\n- The night of 7/11 I will have a late night and probably not sleep optimally.\n- 7/10 looks like it might be a rainy day, so I may not ride.\n\n---\n\n**## Goals**\n\nConsider these short-term objectives:\n\n- I want to ride at least 100 miles this week.\n\n---\n\n**## Food**\n\nThe user has provided the following information about food avaialability and preferences:\n\n- I have bars that have 250 calories each, 43g carbs, 17g sugar, 6g fat, 10g protein.\n- I have gels that have 200 calories each, 48g carbs, 25g sugar, 0g fat, 0g protein.\n- food items cannot be split into smaller portions and should be used whole\n- food should **NEVER** be consumed on rides shorter than 100 minutes\n- aim for around 225 calories per hour on rides greater than 100 minutes. Be sure not to exceed this amount.\n\n---\n\n**## Additional Notes**\n\nAny extra context that may help planning:\n\n- I cannot ride more than 25 miles on weekdays.\n- In general, the day before a long ride should be light recovery or rest.\n\n---\n\n**## Planning Instructions**\n\n- Plan out the schedule starting at the START DATE, and ending at the END DATE.\n- Use FTP zones and recent activity to guide Normalized Power ranges. \n- Use standard Coggan power zones. \n- The approximate time for each ride should be realistic based on the distance and user’s average speed. \n- Use professional cycling advice to determine the appropriate amount of nutrition for each ride, considering the user’s preferences and the intensity of the workout. \n- Ensure the nutrition amounts add up to the correct total calories. \n- all table entries are to be shown in ascending chronological order. \n- HARD CONSTRAINT:\n    - If the next day’s ride is >35 miles, then the previous day’s ride must be one of:\n        - a full rest day\n        - a Zone 1 ride (0-117 W W)\n    - Under no condition can a ride >Zone 1 or >60 minutes occur the day before a long ride\n- Ensure that if a weekly mileage goal is set, the total distance for the week meets or exceeds this goal.\n\n---\n\n**## Output Format**\n\nReturn a Markdown table containing the recommended schedule for plan period. \n\n```markdown\n| Date       | Time (hours)      | Distance Range   | Normalized Power Range | Nutrition            | Notes                     |\n|------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Mon 6/30   | <approx time>     | x-y miles        | XXX–YYY W              | <Food Amount>        | Example workout note      |\n|------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| TOTALS     | <total time>      | <total miles>    |                        |                      |                           |\n```\n\nAfter the schedule, provide a paragraph explaining your rationale. Discuss:\n\n* How the plan aligns with the user’s current FTP and recent load\n* How restrictions and goals influenced the plan\n* How intensity and rest were distributed\n* Any risks or opportunities observed in the activity history\n* Indicate whether the goals are reasonable given the data"

The recent training load indicates a mix of moderate to high-intensity rides, suggesting the user is accustomed to varied intensities. The plan incorporates Zone 2 and Tempo rides to build endurance and maintain fitness without overloading the user.\n\n**Influence of Restrictions and Goals:**\nThe plan respects the user's constraints, such as the need for a light recovery day on 7/7 and the potential for rain on 7/10. The plan also accommodates the user's late night on 7/11 by scheduling a recovery ride the following day. The goal of riding at least 100 miles is met with a total of 117-134 miles for the week.\n\n**Intensity and Rest Distribution:**\nIntensity is balanced across the week, with higher intensity rides on Tuesday and Friday, and a long endurance ride on Saturday. Recovery rides are strategically placed on Thursday and Sunday to ensure adequate rest, especially before and after the long ride.\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\nThe user's recent activity shows a good balance of intensity and recovery, but there is a risk of fatigue if the user does not adhere to the recovery days. The plan provides an opportunity to improve endurance and tempo riding skills, which are crucial for meeting the weekly mileage goal.\n\n**Goal Reasonableness:**\nThe goal of riding at least 100 miles is reasonable given the user's recent activity history and current fitness level. The plan is structured to ensure the user can achieve this goal while maintaining a balanced training load and avoiding overtraining.",
